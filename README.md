## Project Title: Rock, Paper, and Scissors. 

Rock, Paper, and Scissors is the game we chose to incorporate into our Web Application Project. This game is governed by a set of rules that are both simple and essential. A player will compete against a computer and will be offered the option of playing Rock, Paper, or Scissors. After the user makes their initial move, the application will respond with a randomly generated option from the three alternatives presented to it. Additional features will be included in our project, making it undeniably distinctive.

The additional features we included in our project are Player vs Player mode, easy/hard mode, and sudden death mode. (These modes are explained in the function requirements). These modes allow for a better experience and a hard mode will be for experienced players.

## Functions requirements: 

### Intro:

* A page with the game's information and rules will be presented to the user.


* The user will be presented with two different game modes. Player vs CPU, or Player vs Player.

* If the user chooses Player vs CPU, they will be prompted to choose between two difficulty levels, easy or hard.

* In easy mode, the CPU will make inferences on the player's last move, and will counter with a move in the player's favour. 

* In hard mode, the CPU will make inferences on the player's last move, and will counter with a move in opposition of the player's favour. 

*  If the player chooses Player Vs Player, they will also
be presented with two different game modes. They will
choose between normal Player vs Player, or choose a 
special game mode called, "We Feeling Lucky"

* The normal Player vs Player game mode, will continue 
like any, where each Player gets to choose between
rock, paper or sciccors. For the special game mode, 
"We Feeling Lucky", each player will be given a 
random choice between rock, paper, or sciccors, 
making it a randomly generated player vs player game
mode. 

* After the user makes their choice, the game starts.

### Game:

* The player will be prompted to pick between Rock, Paper or Scissors, and will click on their respective symbols to finalize their choice. 

* When Rock, Paper, or Scissors is clicked, images will be displayed on the screen in an animated sequence.

* The web application will then be able to tally a score. The score will be based on wins, loses, or ties.

* The wins, losses, or ties will be displayed on the screen in a score card. 

* After a single round is finished a point will be added to the winner and this will continue to happen until the player wins, loses, or ends with a tie.

* If the scores are equal, the web application will prompt the user with an option to end with a tie, or go to a sudden “death” round. 

### Sudden Death (Special Round) :

* During the sudden death round the web application will become more intense and the page will get darker and will become a little blurry.

* If a sudden death round occurs, we will use the Web Audio API to play an audio track of a heat beat.

### Game Over:

* If the user wins, the web application will display a trophy.

* If the user loses, the web application will display a photo saying “better luck next time”.

* If the user decides to end with a tie, the web application will display a photo with the heading “Tie Game”.
