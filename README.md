Project Title: Rock, Paper, and Scissors

Rock, Paper, and Scissors is the game we chose to incorporate into our Web Application Project. This game is governed by a set of rules that are both simple and essential. A player will compete against a computer and will be offered the option of playing Rock, Paper, or Scissors. After the user makes their initial move, the application will respond with a randomly generated option from the three alternatives presented to it. Additional features will be included in our project, making it undeniably distinctive. A Weather Dashboard, a scoreboard, and a variety of other features will also be included.
